He had been using and enjoying Art of Problem Solving materials for years, completing Beast Academy 3-5 and (to my surprise) enjoying the hefty tome that is AoPS PreAlgebra. But partway through the Intro to Algebra book, something just wasn\u2019t clicking: some chapters he could breeze through with ease, while others just didn\u2019t seem to make sense for him.\n\nOf course, I did what any sane homeschooling parent would do: I panicked. Peatie has loved math since the time he first discovered that he could count his fingers, and back in kindergarten he was clear enough on his preferences to inform me, \u201cI want HARD math, Mommy!\u201d In fact, math is one of the few areas in his life where he seems to thrive on challenge\u2013but he was no longer thriving with the challenge of Art of Problem Solving, and my math skills were too rusty to be of much help. But the general consensus of everyone on the internet is that if you want your kid to have the best, most challenging math, AoPS is the way to go. I was clearly failing my child!\n\nIn the midst of this weeks-long panic, I somehow ran across a mention of the Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science (IMACS) and their challenging middle school curricula, Elements of Mathematics: Foundations. I could find very little information about the course, but what little I found seemed promising. Noting that the first course (of 18, intended to cover a three-year period) was offered for free, I thought I\u2019d let Peatie try it out. He loved it!\n\n\nHere\u2019s a sample screenshot from somewhere in the middle of the second year of material, just so you can get an idea of the format of the program.\nFor the past two years now, Peatie has been working through EMF courses. Since I still rarely see these mentioned online, I thought maybe someone would benefit from a review of them.\n\nEMF consists of 18 courses of varying lengths, intended to take a middle school student through what\u2019s traditionally considered Prealgebra, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Geometry, and Precalculus over the course of three years.\n\nThere are a few downsides to this curricula:\n\nWhile there are in-person classes for those local to IMACS, most of the world would be accessing these classes via the internet. You need a reliable internet connection with speed adequate for downloading the videos in order to do this course. If your internet goes down, you\u2019re outta luck.\nThe symbols and terminology used in this program are so vastly different than those in traditional math classes that parents will likely be able to offer very little help if their student is stuck. Sometimes my son simply needs me to stand in the room as a sounding board, and sometimes I can offer suggestions like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you start over? There\u2019s a chance you made a mistake that you aren\u2019t noticing.\u201d Other than that, I\u2019m not much use. There is a help forum available, and many questions have a little \u201c?\u201d icon with past students\u2019 questions and the suggestions offered to them, but some kids might find this to be too little direct assistance if they\u2019re used to a solution manual or the possibility of parent assistance.\nBecause this program is so different from others, there\u2019s no way to start midway through the program. Every student must start from the very first course. This caused me some hesitation: Peatie had already completed a very solid Prealgebra course and was most of the way through what would be considered Algebra 1. It felt like I would be consigning him to repeat old material and generally slowing his progress by having him start over. I eventually came to my senses, reminding myself that education isn\u2019t a race and it would be far better for him to repeat material and know it very well than to rush ahead just so he could complete Calculus as a high school freshman (and why?). For all my agonizing, he had no complaints about what he was doing. Despite the fact that the first courses he was taking were part of a \u201cPre-Algebra Plus Course Pack,\u201d the approach and scope were so vastly different from what he\u2019d been doing (with titles like \u201cOperational Systems,\u201d \u201cOrdered n-Tuples,\u201d and \u201cNumber Theory\u201d) that it didn\u2019t feel at all like repetition.\nThe pacing for this program is a challenge. Though you know how many courses they expect you to complete in a traditional school year, some courses are much longer or more complex than others, so being halfway through the courses might not mean that you\u2019re halfway through the curriculum. For the first year, IMACS offers a week-by-week progress guide to help the students pace themselves. After that, however, there\u2019s no more guidance offered. While I realize that it\u2019s wonderful to work at your own pace, it\u2019s nice to have some idea how long the course creators expect the material to take. Particularly since my son is a slow worker who is easily side-tracked by his ADHD, it\u2019s nice to have a goal to help him stay on track (and give me an idea whether those three pages took him all week because the problems were especially hard or because he got distracted by the graphing process). *Update: While he managed to finish the first year of courses in one year and looked like he was on track with the second year, the last two courses for the year (13 & 14) were waaay longer than the ones he\u2019d taken so far. He ended up taking about an extra seven months to get through them. That said, I finally found a pacing guide that assigns 450 days for courses 10-14 at 4-5 hours per week. I know my kid is a plodder and distractable,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

He ended up taking about an extra seven months to get through them. That said, I finally found a pacing guide that assigns 450 days for courses 10-14 at 4-5 hours per week.

He ended up taking about an extra seven months to get through them. That said, I finally found a pacing guide that assigns 450 days for courses 10-14 at 4-5 hours per week. I know my kid is a plodder and distractable, so his six hours per week was probably not far off pace. I have no idea how school kids are supposed to finish 450 days of assignments in a year\u2013although I found another document that suggested that the kids taking this in Florida public schools should plan to work over the summer and during weekends and school holidays.\nIt\u2019s not inexpensive. Currently the courses are listed at $60 apiece, which adds up in a hurry; HOWEVER, you can save a lot by buying a \u201cCourse Pack,\u201d which bundles all the courses for one year into a single purchase. (The first year, made of Courses 1-9, rings up at $360, while the next two years are around $250 each.) That said, if you\u2019re considering getting instructional help for AoPS, even their self-paced courses are $460 per semester\u2013not including textbooks\u2013at which point $350 per year doesn\u2019t sound so bad.\n\nThose were the drawbacks: now for the positives of EMF.\n\nIt\u2019s less expensive than many of the alternatives. I researched online AoPS instruction, both from AoPS itself and from other providers, and I couldn\u2019t find classes from institutions I\u2019d heard of for less than $800/year. (I did find an obscure provider offering $25/month classes, but I was concerned about paying $200\u2013plus the cost of the book\u2013for an instructor I knew nothing about.) Local math tutors offered services starting at $25/hour. Again, even $350 sounded like a bargain compared to the alternatives.\nIt\u2019s challenging. My son is thriving because EMF is stretching him to think of math in new ways, and he\u2019s loving it. Though AoPS is an excellent program, it\u2019s not the only amazing program out there.\nIt\u2019s fun. While EMF has a lot of text, similar to AoPS, there are also silly little videos (okay, mostly audio) featuring students and a professor discussing the concepts that are being taught. My son enjoys the humor these characters add to the learning process, and he gets a kick out of the fact that he can \u201clevel up\u201d as he learns. In addition, EMF sprinkles in silly problems (similar to AoPS) and offers interactive elements so you can better visualize the math you\u2019re doing. (The one downside: sometimes my ADHD son gets so into testing different things with these interactive models that he completely loses track of time.)\nRemember how I mentioned that I couldn\u2019t really help my son with math because the symbols and terminology are so different? While that\u2019s a drawback, it\u2019s also a positive. Because he can\u2019t expect me to rush over and clarify, Peatie has had to become a little more independent. For a child who loves my apron strings, this has been great. He\u2019s learned to re-read confusing passages, look up terms in the index, re-work incorrect problems, and check out the help forum\u2013all skills that will serve him well as he faces challenging courses in the future. And the fact that he\u2019s experienced success in problem-solving has bolstered his confidence that he can do this on his own.\nIt seems to be effectively developing his understanding of math. I have my kids take a standardized test each year to make sure they\u2019re comfortable with the format of major tests and give me information about their strengths and weaknesses. Last year I had Peatie take the MAP Algebra 1 test, figuring that even though he was still finishing Pre-Algebra in EMF, he\u2019d already taken most of Algebra 1 through AoPS. This year I was scratching my head at what to do: I didn\u2019t feel like he should re-take the Algebra 1 test that he\u2019d done well on, but he technically hadn\u2019t completed the Algebra 1 material in EMF and hadn\u2019t even touched on Geometry yet. In the end, I signed him up for Algebra 2 and told him to do his best and not worry about it. He scored in the 98th percentile on the test, despite technically still being in the middle of Algebra 1.\n\nWell, that\u2019s all that I can think of for now. I hope that this report is helpful to someone else who is looking for a challenging math alternative to AoPS.\n######################\nOutput:"}}
