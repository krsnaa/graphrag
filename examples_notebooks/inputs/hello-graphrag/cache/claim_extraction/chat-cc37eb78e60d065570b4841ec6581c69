Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

He had been using and enjoying Art of Problem Solving materials for years, completing Beast Academy 3-5 and (to my surprise) enjoying the hefty tome that is AoPS PreAlgebra. But partway through the Intro to Algebra book, something just wasn\u2019t clicking: some chapters he could breeze through with ease, while others just didn\u2019t seem to make sense for him.\n\nOf course, I did what any sane homeschooling parent would do: I panicked. Peatie has loved math since the time he first discovered that he could count his fingers, and back in kindergarten he was clear enough on his preferences to inform me, \u201cI want HARD math, Mommy!\u201d In fact, math is one of the few areas in his life where he seems to thrive on challenge\u2013but he was no longer thriving with the challenge of Art of Problem Solving, and my math skills were too rusty to be of much help. But the general consensus of everyone on the internet is that if you want your kid to have the best, most challenging math, AoPS is the way to go. I was clearly failing my child!\n\nIn the midst of this weeks-long panic, I somehow ran across a mention of the Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science (IMACS) and their challenging middle school curricula, Elements of Mathematics: Foundations. I could find very little information about the course, but what little I found seemed promising. Noting that the first course (of 18, intended to cover a three-year period) was offered for free, I thought I\u2019d let Peatie try it out. He loved it!\n\n\nHere\u2019s a sample screenshot from somewhere in the middle of the second year of material, just so you can get an idea of the format of the program.\nFor the past two years now, Peatie has been working through EMF courses. Since I still rarely see these mentioned online, I thought maybe someone would benefit from a review of them.\n\nEMF consists of 18 courses of varying lengths, intended to take a middle school student through what\u2019s traditionally considered Prealgebra, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Geometry, and Precalculus over the course of three years.\n\nThere are a few downsides to this curricula:\n\nWhile there are in-person classes for those local to IMACS, most of the world would be accessing these classes via the internet. You need a reliable internet connection with speed adequate for downloading the videos in order to do this course. If your internet goes down, you\u2019re outta luck.\nThe symbols and terminology used in this program are so vastly different than those in traditional math classes that parents will likely be able to offer very little help if their student is stuck. Sometimes my son simply needs me to stand in the room as a sounding board, and sometimes I can offer suggestions like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you start over? There\u2019s a chance you made a mistake that you aren\u2019t noticing.\u201d Other than that, I\u2019m not much use. There is a help forum available, and many questions have a little \u201c?\u201d icon with past students\u2019 questions and the suggestions offered to them, but some kids might find this to be too little direct assistance if they\u2019re used to a solution manual or the possibility of parent assistance.\nBecause this program is so different from others, there\u2019s no way to start midway through the program. Every student must start from the very first course. This caused me some hesitation: Peatie had already completed a very solid Prealgebra course and was most of the way through what would be considered Algebra 1. It felt like I would be consigning him to repeat old material and generally slowing his progress by having him start over. I eventually came to my senses, reminding myself that education isn\u2019t a race and it would be far better for him to repeat material and know it very well than to rush ahead just so he could complete Calculus as a high school freshman (and why?). For all my agonizing, he had no complaints about what he was doing. Despite the fact that the first courses he was taking were part of a \u201cPre-Algebra Plus Course Pack,\u201d the approach and scope were so vastly different from what he\u2019d been doing (with titles like \u201cOperational Systems,\u201d \u201cOrdered n-Tuples,\u201d and \u201cNumber Theory\u201d) that it didn\u2019t feel at all like repetition.\nThe pacing for this program is a challenge. Though you know how many courses they expect you to complete in a traditional school year, some courses are much longer or more complex than others, so being halfway through the courses might not mean that you\u2019re halfway through the curriculum. For the first year, IMACS offers a week-by-week progress guide to help the students pace themselves. After that, however, there\u2019s no more guidance offered. While I realize that it\u2019s wonderful to work at your own pace, it\u2019s nice to have some idea how long the course creators expect the material to take. Particularly since my son is a slow worker who is easily side-tracked by his ADHD, it\u2019s nice to have a goal to help him stay on track (and give me an idea whether those three pages took him all week because the problems were especially hard or because he got distracted by the graphing process). *Update: While he managed to finish the first year of courses in one year and looked like he was on track with the second year, the last two courses for the year (13 & 14) were waaay longer than the ones he\u2019d taken so far. He ended up taking about an extra seven months to get through them. That said, I finally found a pacing guide that assigns 450 days for courses 10-14 at 4-5 hours per week. I know my kid is a plodder and distractable,\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
