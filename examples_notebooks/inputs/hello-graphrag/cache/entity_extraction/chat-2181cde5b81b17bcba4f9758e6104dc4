He ended up taking about an extra seven months to get through them. That said, I finally found a pacing guide that assigns 450 days for courses 10-14 at 4-5 hours per week. I know my kid is a plodder and distractable, so his six hours per week was probably not far off pace. I have no idea how school kids are supposed to finish 450 days of assignments in a year\u2013although I found another document that suggested that the kids taking this in Florida public schools should plan to work over the summer and during weekends and school holidays.\nIt\u2019s not inexpensive. Currently the courses are listed at $60 apiece, which adds up in a hurry; HOWEVER, you can save a lot by buying a \u201cCourse Pack,\u201d which bundles all the courses for one year into a single purchase. (The first year, made of Courses 1-9, rings up at $360, while the next two years are around $250 each.) That said, if you\u2019re considering getting instructional help for AoPS, even their self-paced courses are $460 per semester\u2013not including textbooks\u2013at which point $350 per year doesn\u2019t sound so bad.\n\nThose were the drawbacks: now for the positives of EMF.\n\nIt\u2019s less expensive than many of the alternatives. I researched online AoPS instruction, both from AoPS itself and from other providers, and I couldn\u2019t find classes from institutions I\u2019d heard of for less than $800/year. (I did find an obscure provider offering $25/month classes, but I was concerned about paying $200\u2013plus the cost of the book\u2013for an instructor I knew nothing about.) Local math tutors offered services starting at $25/hour. Again, even $350 sounded like a bargain compared to the alternatives.\nIt\u2019s challenging. My son is thriving because EMF is stretching him to think of math in new ways, and he\u2019s loving it. Though AoPS is an excellent program, it\u2019s not the only amazing program out there.\nIt\u2019s fun. While EMF has a lot of text, similar to AoPS, there are also silly little videos (okay, mostly audio) featuring students and a professor discussing the concepts that are being taught. My son enjoys the humor these characters add to the learning process, and he gets a kick out of the fact that he can \u201clevel up\u201d as he learns. In addition, EMF sprinkles in silly problems (similar to AoPS) and offers interactive elements so you can better visualize the math you\u2019re doing. (The one downside: sometimes my ADHD son gets so into testing different things with these interactive models that he completely loses track of time.)\nRemember how I mentioned that I couldn\u2019t really help my son with math because the symbols and terminology are so different? While that\u2019s a drawback, it\u2019s also a positive. Because he can\u2019t expect me to rush over and clarify, Peatie has had to become a little more independent. For a child who loves my apron strings, this has been great. He\u2019s learned to re-read confusing passages, look up terms in the index, re-work incorrect problems, and check out the help forum\u2013all skills that will serve him well as he faces challenging courses in the future. And the fact that he\u2019s experienced success in problem-solving has bolstered his confidence that he can do this on his own.\nIt seems to be effectively developing his understanding of math. I have my kids take a standardized test each year to make sure they\u2019re comfortable with the format of major tests and give me information about their strengths and weaknesses. Last year I had Peatie take the MAP Algebra 1 test, figuring that even though he was still finishing Pre-Algebra in EMF, he\u2019d already taken most of Algebra 1 through AoPS. This year I was scratching my head at what to do: I didn\u2019t feel like he should re-take the Algebra 1 test that he\u2019d done well on, but he technically hadn\u2019t completed the Algebra 1 material in EMF and hadn\u2019t even touched on Geometry yet. In the end, I signed him up for Algebra 2 and told him to do his best and not worry about it. He scored in the 98th percentile on the test, despite technically still being in the middle of Algebra 1.\n\nWell, that\u2019s all that I can think of for now. I hope that this report is helpful to someone else who is looking for a challenging math alternative to AoPS.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
